#### hi there, these are my notes that I used to study for EXAM 1 for STAT340 at UW Madison

I feel like I have a hard time breaking down complex math jargon when it comes to notes
even though [Brian's lecture notes](https://brianreedpowers.github.io/stat340/) are absoultley A1. IDK these just helped me understand the content better
and I figured that I would put them on GH in case it might help some other DS or CS student with this class :P

The "deep intuition guide" is really comprehensive and i feel like it just is a good thing to skim if you are lost
great for homewroks / quick reference and knowing what you need to know

The "intuitive guide" is more of a "oh shit i have no idea what im doing because i blew off this class for three weeks and need to understand this in a way thats reasonable.
I feel like it does a good job of breaking down things into plain english and builds like the "why" behind all of this stuff.
