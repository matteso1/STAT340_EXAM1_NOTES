# Yo, these are my notes that I used to study for EXAM 1 for STAT340 at UW Madison
I feel like I have a hard time breaking down complex math jargon when it comes to notes
even though [Brian's lecture notes](https://brianreedpowers.github.io/stat340/) are absoultley A1. IDK these just helped me understand the content better
and I figured that I would put them on GH in case it might help some other DS or CS student with this class :P
